                <h3>CONCEPT OF FLOOD SHELTER</h3>
                <p>The implementation of any flood alleviation scheme has four basic aims – (i) to
                    reduce flooding, (ii) to reduce damage, (iii) to save lives, and (iv) to save
                    property. A particular scheme may cover all four of these e.g., building
                    embankments to protect vulnerable areas. On the other hand, small-scale projects
                    such as flood shelters may help in saving lives and properties. These shelters can
                    be used to manage relief and rehabilitation activities in an organized way</p>

                <p>The children of today are gearing up to become adult citizens of tomorrow. The growth is parallel to
                    the future of our country, reflected through quality of the present education system. A school must
                    stimulate curiosity in the young, impressionable minds and equip them with tools to be better human
